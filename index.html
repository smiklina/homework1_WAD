            The Delta Career Day brings together employers and students of the Institute of Computer Science, Institute
            of Mathematics and Statistics and the School of Economics and Business Administration. At the event,
            companies can offer traineeship and promote job opportunities, as well as build their reputation as an
            employer. Students in turn get an idea of which companies are looking for employees, where to find a good
            traineeship placement and where they might work in the future.
